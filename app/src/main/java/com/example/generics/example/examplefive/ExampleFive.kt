    //Notice that once element is on in or out position, different type of casting is default and it cannot be stopped

    // This is what happened in our array example. Covariance allowed up-casting, and in position allowed down-casting. Using this two mechanism together we can cast to everything. Similarly with contravariance and out position. Together can help developer cast any type to any other. The only problem is that if an actual type cannot be casted this way then we have a runtime error.

    //The only way to prevent this is to prohibit connection of public in-positions and contravariance, and public our-positions and variance. This is why Kotlin has this limitation. Kotlin also solved array problem by making all arrays invariant.
